  Training recipe for style transfer LoRAs on Flux models.
  Learn an artistic style (illustration, anime, watercolor, etc.) from
  15-30 reference images. The LoRA applies the learned aesthetic to any subject.

    Best for: artistic styles, illustration aesthetics, rendering techniques.
    Dataset: 15-30 images in the target style, diverse subjects.
    Result: trigger word applies the style to any prompt.

  tips:
    - "More images = better style coverage. 20-30 is ideal"
    - "Include diverse subjects (people, landscapes, objects) all in the target style"
    - "Higher rank (32) captures style nuance better than faces"
    - "Lower learning rate (5e-5) prevents overfitting to specific images"
    - "Weight 0.5-0.8 blends naturally — 1.0 can be too strong"
    - "Combine with a face LoRA for styled portraits"
