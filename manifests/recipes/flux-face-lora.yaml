  Training recipe for face/portrait LoRAs on Flux models.
  Optimized for learning a specific person's likeness from 10-20 photos.
  Produces a LoRA that generates consistent portraits with a trigger word.
  Works with both flux-schnell (fast) and flux-dev (quality).

    Best for: headshots, portraits, consistent character identity.
    Dataset: 10-20 high-quality face photos, varied angles/lighting.
    Result: trigger word activates the learned face in any prompt.

  tips:
    - "Use 10-20 photos with varied angles, expressions, and lighting"
    - "Avoid sunglasses, heavy makeup, or occlusions in training images"
    - "Caption with Florence-2 for best results — it describes face features well"
    - "If likeness is weak, increase steps to 2000 or rank to 32"
    - "If overfitting (same pose every time), reduce steps to 1000"
    - "Weight 0.7-0.9 is the sweet spot — too high causes artifacts"
