  Training recipe for face/portrait LoRAs on Z-Image Turbo.
  Similar to the Flux face recipe but optimized for Z-Image Turbo's
  architecture — faster training, faster inference, lower VRAM.
  Good option for 16GB GPU users.

  tips:
    - "Z-Image Turbo uses CFG 0.0 — don't add guidance"
    - "Only 8 steps needed — sub-second on a good GPU"
    - "Training is faster than Flux (~10 min on A100)"
    - "Quality is close to Flux Schnell but inference is faster"
    - "Good choice when you need volume over perfection"
